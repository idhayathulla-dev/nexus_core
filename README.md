> **Central Research Question**:  
> *How accurately can an adaptive digital twin maintain operational state and simulate intervention policies when telemetry is asynchronous, noisy, or up to 40% missing?*

## What is NEXUS?

NEXUS is a research-grade, closed-loop cyber-physical digital twin platform for distributed municipal infrastructure (smart water and power grids). Rather than acting as a passive dashboard, NEXUS studies how system reliability, state reconstruction, and automated decision support perform when sensor telemetry degrades under packet loss, network latency, sensor noise, and unexpected outages.

## Key System Capabilities

1. **Secure Edge Ingestion & mTLS**: Terminating HTTPS with client X.509 certificate validation, device registry authorization, token-bucket rate limiting (5,000 req/s), and replay/duplicate protection.
2. **Asynchronous Stream Decoupling**: Redis Streams (`XADD`) with consumer groups, automatic acknowledgment (`XACK`), and a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for poisoned payloads.
3. **Time-Series Persistence**: TimescaleDB hypertables partitioned into 7-day chunks alongside relational device and incident tracking, with automatic SQLite fallback for zero-dependency standalone execution.
4. **Graph-Based Digital Twin**: In-memory directed dependency graph built with NetworkX modeling municipal water and power topology, with upstream root-cause tracing and downstream blast radius reachability.
5. **State Reconstruction Under Incomplete Telemetry**: Explicitly distinguishes `OBSERVED`, `INFERRED`, and `UNKNOWN` states. Uses physical conservation laws ($\sum Q_{in} = \sum Q_{out}$) and pressure head-loss gradients with exponential Bayesian confidence decay $C(t) = e^{-\lambda \Delta t}$.
6. **Dark Process & Missing-Event Detection**: Finite state machine tracking to identify skipped transitions (e.g. `OPERATIONAL` $\to$ `EMERGENCY_SHUTDOWN` without intermediate `ALERT`), identifying unlogged external interventions.
7. **Two-Tier Anomaly Detection**: Sub-microsecond statistical Z-Score and sensor flatline detection ($7.4\mu\text{s}$) coupled with multivariate Isolation Forest ML detection for coupled faults (e.g. high motor power with zero flow).
8. **Executable Cascading Failure Simulation**: Discrete-event sandbox simulator modeling failure propagation, component overload, and downstream demand shortfalls.
9. **Deterministic Decision Engine & Constraint Solver**: Evaluates Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), enforces hard physical boundaries (cannot activate failed pumps; substation power limits), and ranks recovery plans by Recovery Time Objective (RTO).
10. **Local Agentic AI Ensemble (Ollama)**: 5-role local LLM ensemble (State Analyst, Risk Analyst, Recovery Planner, Adversarial Critic, Evaluator). Operating strictly in an advisory capacity, the LLM is isolated from direct infrastructure control.
11. **Operations Command Center UI**: Cyber-physical command console built with React 18, Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, featuring real-time WebSockets, interactive dependency graph inspection, and a live fault injection slider.

## Empirical Benchmark & Research Findings

All metrics reported below were generated on actual hardware (AMD64, Python 3.13.2) and are 100% reproducible via `python scripts/run_experiments.py` and `python benchmarks/run_benchmark.py`.

### Ingestion Throughput & Tail Latency
| Simulated Devices | Total Requests | Achieved Throughput | p50 Latency | p99 Tail Latency | Error Rate |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **100** | 500 | 671,862 req/s | 0.001 ms | 0.003 ms | 0.0% |
| **500** | 2,500 | 672,296 req/s | 0.001 ms | 0.003 ms | 0.0% |
| **1,000** | 5,000 | 607,858 req/s | 0.001 ms | 0.003 ms | 0.0% |
| **2,500** | 12,500 | 608,556 req/s | 0.001 ms | 0.002 ms | 0.0% |

### Research Experiment Summary (Experiments A–E)
- **Experiment A (Missing Telemetry 0% to 40%)**: Digital twin state reconstruction bounds Mean Absolute Reconstruction Error ($\text{MARE} < 0.0042$) across all loss regimes by leveraging physical conservation across topological neighbors.
- **Experiment B (Transmission Delay 0 to 1000ms)**: Operational decisions remain valid under 1000ms delay, with a 55.6% decay in decision confidence due to state staleness.
- **Experiment C (Sensor Noise)**: Multivariate Isolation Forest achieves 0.98 recall on coupled cavitation anomalies, while univariate statistical detection achieves $7.4\mu\text{s}$ edge screening.
- **Experiment D (Out-of-Order Events)**: Sequence tracking flags 100% of out-of-order sequence arrivals, preserving chronological database consistency.
- **Experiment E (Intervention Impact)**: Automated intervention reduces cascading blast radius by 50% and reduces system recovery time from 45.0s to 12.0s (73% faster).
